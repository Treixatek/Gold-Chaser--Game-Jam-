# What is Gold Chaser
This is a small single or two player game with the purpose of surviving the longest and obtaining the msot gold. The helicopters have gold crates which can only be taken by switching into the second dimension and flying into the crates. However, in this dimension the platforms are invisible so you may get yeeted, especially since the platforms spawn at intense levels towards the end.
